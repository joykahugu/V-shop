# V-shop
Creating an e commerce website with CSS,HTML and Vanilla JS.
VShop is a fully functional e-commerce web application built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It offers essential shopping features with a clean, responsive interface. Firebase Authentication is used exclusively for secure Google and email/password login. Product data is served from a static JSON file or a mock/products API. Cart data is managed locally using the browser's localStorage.
The application is ideal for developers learning front-end development and simple user authentication, while also demonstrating a modern e-commerce experience without a backend database.
